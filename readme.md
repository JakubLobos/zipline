# Simple Zipline Simulator

**Project Description:**
This project is a simple zipline simulator created for university coursework in physics/computer science. The application is built with **TypeScript, HTML, and Canvas** and aims to visualize a character sliding along a line between two points.

**Features:**

- Define start (A) and end (B) points of the zipline
- Generate intermediate points along the line for physics calculations
- Draw the zipline on a canvas
- Render a character moving along the zipline
- Optional debug mode to visualize intermediate points

**Purpose:**
The project demonstrates basic physics concepts like motion along an inclined line, simple animations, and working with HTML canvas in a structured TypeScript project.
